**OpenAI GPT-2 Text Generation with Python**

**Project Overview:**

This GitHub project showcases the implementation of OpenAI's GPT-2, a powerful language model, for text generation tasks. GPT-2 is known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, making it suitable for various natural language processing applications.

**Installation:**

To run this project locally, you'll need to install the `transformers` library and its dependencies. You can do this using the following command:

```
!pip install transformers
```

**Usage:**

The project provides a Python script that demonstrates how to use the GPT-2 model for text generation. Here's a brief overview of the key components and how to generate text:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   
   - The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including `torch` and `transformers`.

2. **Load Pre-trained GPT-2 Model:**
   
   - You can choose the model size you want (e.g., "gpt2-medium") and load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer using the `transformers` library.

3. **Set Model to Evaluation Mode:**
   
   - The script sets the GPT-2 model to evaluation mode using `model.eval()`.

4. **Define a Text Generation Function:**
   
   - The `generate_text` function is defined to generate text based on a given prompt. You can customize parameters such as `max_length`, `temperature`, and `top_k` to control the output.

5. **Example Prompt:**
   
   - An example prompt is provided: "Once upon a time."

6. **Generate Text:**
   
   - The script generates text based on the example prompt using the `generate_text` function.

7. **Print Generated Text:**
   
   - The generated text is printed to the console.

**Example Output:**

```
Once upon a time, I was a member of Parliament, I was a teacher, I was responsible for public health... I'm now an executive director at the Australian Council of Social Service.
```

**Project Goals:**

- Demonstrate how to use the GPT-2 model for text generation tasks.
- Provide a clear and concise example of generating text from a given prompt.
- Serve as a starting point for incorporating GPT-2 into more complex natural language processing projects.
